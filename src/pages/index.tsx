    <h2>Hi there</h2>

      Redux, GraphQL, Gastby, Next.js, Jest and Cypress. A quick thinker and
      avid learner, I onboard efficiently - and proactively learn any necessary
      technologies - to be swiftly operational on client projects.

      In the past, I have worked in communications, graphic and UX design,
      product ownership, and project management. From having explored the
      spectrum of work that goes into creating user-centric products, I
      empathize with clients and adapt development to their business needs.{" "}
