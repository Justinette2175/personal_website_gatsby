description: I worked with the marketing team of Cryptocurrency Security
  provider Kn0x to design and implement the updated version of their website.
  I  propose design concepts built on Sketch and worked iteratively with the
  client to accommodate their requests with updates. Once we settled on a
  design, I implemented the website using React.js on a Gatsby architecture.
