In the fall of 2020, I attented the Concordia class CART360, Tangible Media, as an independent student. In this class, I learned to built simple electronic circuits and write code to control Arduino boards. It is the excitement and passion I felt for the projects I engaged in in this class that cemented my decision to pursue interaction design and interactive arts as a professional career.
