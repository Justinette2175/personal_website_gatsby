### Background

In the fall of 2020, I attented the Concordia class CART360, Tangible Media, as an independent student. In this class, I learned to built simple electronic circuits and write code to control Arduino boards. It is the excitement and passion I felt for the projects I engaged in in this class that cemented my decision to pursue interaction design and interactive arts as a professional career.

In this semester-long project, I focused on building a home-based interactive artifact to simplify the process of building habits towards achieving desired personal goals. Noticing how hard it is for me to commit to a daily practice of a musical instrument or of body exercises, I wanted to try and ease out aspects of friction that we experience around doing activities that we would like to engage in, but sometimes find hard to get started on.

The artifact is thought out for individuals who have meaningful long-term goals that could be reachable through repetitive practice, but who struggle to commit to daily engagement in the practice.

### Project

Throughout the class, I submitted the following written papers explaining my process and progress.

- [Initial Proposal](/pdf/JustineG_Prototype.pdf)
- [First Prototypes](/pdf/JustineG_Prototype.pdf)
- [Final Artifact](/pdf/JustineG_Final_Artifact.pdf)

The following video outlines the stages of completing this project, from conceptual research and proposal to incremental rapid propotyping, to building a final artifact.
