### Background

In the midst of the first COVID confinement in the Spring of 2020, I participated in the _Post COVID Challenge_ organized by the Cooperation and Desjardins. The ask of this two-week long competition was to design and prototype a solution to facilitate the evaluation of students in an online learning context. Together with Emmanuelle Germain, a French literature high-school teacher we researched, designed, prototyped, tested, and pitched Pinglit, a collaborative reading platform.

Pinglit was Grand Prize Winner of the Education stream of the Post Covid Challenge.

### Project

Pinglit is a pinterest-like web and mobile app which encourages students to annotate and collect books as they read them.

Teachers can use Pinglit in their classes to spark discussions between students, provide helpful notes on sections of the books to facilitate understanding, and reading comprehension quizzes at the end of certain chapters.

As they read a book, students create and comment on multimedia pins which can contain images, sounds, videos, links, etc. The pins are organized on a horizontal timeline so that they relate to a passage of the book, and so that a student can scroll to the right to see pins in a chronological order. Zooming out on the interface displays beautiful multi-sensorial summaries of the studentâ€™s impressions of the book. Students treat the app like a repository of all the books they read and the emotions and thoughts that each sparked.
