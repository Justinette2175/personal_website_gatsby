**People spend too long waiting on hold on the phone. Text Skip the Line with the name of the service provider you are trying to reach. Skip the Line places the call for you and calls your phone back once a human customer service representative is on the line.**

The application uses natural language processing to determine what number to call. It then dials the number and makes the appropriate button selections before an algorithm trained with supervised learning parses the call audio and determines when a real person is on the line. At that point, an automated message plays for the customer service representative while the system dials the user’s phone number to put them on the line.

For the competition, I came up with a preliminary concept and recruited a team of developers and marketers and help bring it to life. Over a weekend, we undertook user and market research, built a functional prototype of this service, created a pitch deck and pitched to the jury of Startup Weekend AI. Our team won first place in the Montreal competition. After the event, we produced summary pitch videos and **won both the overall Startup Weekend Canada and Startup Weekend Global competitions**.
