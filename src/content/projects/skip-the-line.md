### Background

When I was in the process of emigrating to Canada, I spent long and frustrating hours waiting on hold on the phone to reach Immigration Canada's saturated hotlines. When I participated in the Montreal edition of the _Startup Weekend AI_ hackathon, I pitched this concept to other partcipants and as a team we spent 48 hours doing user research, designing a solution, building a functional prototype, and creating a business plan and pitch deck which we presented to a jury of investors. Our project, _Skip the Line_, won the Montreal Competition. It went on to win Startup Weekend Canada, and eventually Startup Weekend Global, where twams from all over the world competed.

### Project

People spend too long waiting on hold on the phone. Text Skip the Line with the name of the service provider you are trying to reach. Skip the Line places the call for you and calls your phone back once a human customer service representative is on the line.

The application uses natural language processing to determine what number to call. It then dials the number and makes the appropriate button selections before an algorithm trained with supervised learning parses the call audio and determines when a real person is on the line. At that point, an automated message plays for the customer service representative while the system dials the userâ€™s phone number to put them on the line.

This system allows a person to be connected through to a customer service representative without ever having to make a phone call or wait on hold.

The following video summarizes the product and gives an overview of our initial business plan.
