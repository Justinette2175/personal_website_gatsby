Not an artist is a painting of a person trying their hand at painting for one of the first times since becoming an adult, after claiming that they didn't know how to paint. Late at night, and after I spent time talking them into trying to paint, we sat down on the floor and began painting together, me taking them as a subject. By painting with broad strokes and only using shades of blue, I tried to convey the dreamy feeling of first making the discovery of how one can forget oneself into a painting and lose track of time, as we painted late into the night.
