I write poetry and have arranged a number of my poems as songs that I perform at open mic events in the city. The following video is a live set of a donzen songs I wrote and performed at the Yellow Door Coffeehouse in 2007. I invited singers Mikayla Kaminski and Joseph Monroe to accompany me on some of the pieces.

<h4>
The Willow
</h4>
<p>
It’s the middle of the night </br>
And I’m awake and I can’t find the light</br>
I’m feeling at the walls around the room</br>
And I’ve been going around in circles for an hour</br>
</p>
<p>
Ever since you left my world my dear</br>
My heart wouldn’t let anyone near</br>
What if I were a willow too</br>
</p>
And then I found that all around</br>
It’s just the blind leading the blinder</br>
And maybe it’s as fine </br>
That I don’t know what I don’t know</br>
</p>
<p>
I don’t judge the cedar’s bark</br>
Or the way the willow cries and I see</br>
In the light around, in the weather</br>
They withstand reason for their crookedness</br>
</p>
<p>
But for you my love always falls short</br>
And I find fault with your every thought</br>
What if you were a willow too?</br>

<h4>
Flight
</h4>
<p>
I take off on my own too wings</br>
There’s a flock awaiting on the other side</br>
The ocean is wide</br>
</p>
<p>
I take off on my own two wings </br>
On a thought I had a long time ago</br>
I follow</br>
</p>
<p>
Hold me down, hold me down</br>
While I learn to fly</br>
I’m afraid of climbing too high</br>
Too high oh</br>
Hold me down, hold me down</br>
While I learn to fly</br>
As one</br>
</p>
<p>
I take off solo on a whim </br>
Trusting in the air I cannot see</br>
Holding me</br>
</p>
<p>
I take off on a gust of wind</br>
Surrendering</br>
</p>

<h4>
Daughter
</h4>
Love without fear </br>
Love it will crucify you bare</br>
And it will heal you all the same</br>
My daughter love, my daughter love</br>
</p>
<p>
Dance in your mind and dance alone</br>
When you’re broken open </br>
It will make you whole and bring you home</br>
My daughter dance my daughter dance</br>
</p>
<p>
Love, Dance, All you have is time</br>
And all things change, so love and dance</br>
</p>
<p>
Sing your joys and sing your sorrows</br>
Your words will give you wings</br>
Your tunes carry you home </br>
My daughter sing my daughter sing</br>
</p>
<p>
Draw in color draw in black</br>
Draw with all the things you lack</br>
Let you hands fill out the white</br>
My daughter draw, my daughter draw</br>
</p>
<p>
Bear a child into the world</br>
And watch her precious life unfurl</br>
Watch her fall, and get back up</br>
And fall again, and fall again</br>
</p>
<p>
There’s nothing to be said</br>
</p>
<p>
Feel, oh feel, </br>
it cannot be helped if you try</br>
You might as well stay for the ride</br>
My daughter feel, my daughter feel</br>
</p>
<p>
And pray for yourself and pray for nothing</br>
Surrender to this life</br>
May your heart become your home</br>
My daughter pray my daughter pray</br>
