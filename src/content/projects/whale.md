![Whale Diorama](whale.png "Whale Diorama")

This year, I confirmed my interest in the Computation Arts program by taking classes at Concordia as an independent student. In CART 361, I learned the basics of using Blender to create lo-fi characters and scenes.Â 

I was inspired to create this scene shortly after going on a whale-seeing boat trip in the Saguenay Fjord. For our first class assignment, a diorama, I wanted to convey the excitement and uneasiness that I saw people experiencing on the boat ride when a whale surprised us by spewing water right onto our boat. I exaggerated the scene to feature a whale jumping out of the water and added transparency in the water so that the tail of the whale is slightly visible.
