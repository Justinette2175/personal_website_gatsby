I worked with the marketing team of Cryptocurrency Security provider Kn0x to design and implement the updated version of their website. I propose design concepts built on Sketch and worked iteratively with the client to accommodate their requests with updates. Once we settled on a design, I implemented the website using React.js on a Gatsby architecture.
