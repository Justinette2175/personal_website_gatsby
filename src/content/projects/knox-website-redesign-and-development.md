_The code for this application is proprietary and cannot be shared_

### Background

I currently work as a freelance web developer and In 2020, I worked on a multiple contracts for Cryptocurrency Custody provider Kn0x. I initially cleaned up the codebase of their internal asset management portal and augmented it with additional features, but as the application is internal I am not able to feature this project in my portfolio.

I then went on to design and implement the updated version of the Kn0x website.

### Project

I proposed design concepts built on Sketch and worked iteratively with the client to accommodate their requests with updates. Once we settled on a design, I implemented the website using React.js on a Gatsby architecture.
