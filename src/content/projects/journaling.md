### Background

At times when I wasn't doing so well, I started to sketch out my day every evening, writing down and illustrating thoughts that were meaningful to me, experiences that I had had that day, and quotes from literature that I was reading. Keeping track of my feelings and the passing time in this way helped me make sense of the turmoil I was going through. Today, they are a surprisingly cherished memento of times that I did not think I would want to remember at the time.
