I painted _Pregnant_ when I first started experiencing such severe period pain that I would have to rush home from work each month wincing in pain, seeing white, sweating profusely, and vomiting. I was told by a doctor that I had to realize that pain was normal; that the effort of looking for a diagnosis was useless since there are no treatments for conditions like endometriosis; that the pain was my fault: I should be on birth control even if if negatively affects my mood because it wouldn't be good for my mental health either if I had an abortion.

_Pregnant_ was borne out of anger, frustration, and a reverance for the paradox of how my reproductive system has a potential to be at once a source of tremendous pain and a source of tremendous joy.
