### Background

Monique is a 3D character that I completed as part of the CART 361 - 3D Digital Production I class, which I attended as an independent student in the fall of 2020.

### The project

I was inspired to create Monique at a time when I was thinking a lot about growing older and settling into an adult live. As we grow older, it seems to me the mind feels younger than what younger people imagine we feel like. I only knew my grandma as an older person and so to me she must have always been comfortable and have identified with being older. I'm only starting to realize now that it most likely wasn't so. When given the opportunity to create a humanod character, I decided to imagine an older character who is growing through the process of accepting her changing body, yet isn't trying to artificially appear younger.
