Monique is the name I gave to the 3D character model that I completed as part of the CART 361 - 3D Digital Production I class that I attended as an independent student in the fall of 2020.

I was inspired to create monique at a time when I was thinking a lot about growing older and about as we grow older, our own mind often feels younger than what younger people imagine we feel like: I only knew my grandma as an older person and so to me she must have always been comfortable and have identified with being older. I'm only starting to realize now that it most likely wasn't so. When given the opportunity to create a humanod character, I decided to imagine an older character who is growing through the process of accepting her changing body, yet isn't trying to artificially appear younger through her clothes or with surgery.

_Sculpted with Blender. Textured with Substance Painter. Animated with Unity._
