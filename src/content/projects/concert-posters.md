_Made with Adobe Illustrator_

### Background

In 2015, as I was starting to explore a budding interest for web technologies and design, I completed the three-months Graphic Design for Web Applications Certificate at the Concordia School of Continuing Education, where I learned to work with Illustrator, Indesign, and Photoshop, as well as the basics of web development. This initial experience eventually led me to my current career as a web applications developer.

### Project

For my Illustrator II class final project, I made a series of posters made for a house concert by Montreal band The Chinese Kiwis. The poster in the series complement each other as they play with composition and contrast to draw people in to the band's cute and whimsical musical atmosphere.
